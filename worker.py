# This file will be executed by Celery.
# To run the Celery worker, you would typically use a command like:
# celery -A worker worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo -P eventlet
# Or for Windows:
# celery -A worker worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo

# The tasks are imported from the `tasks` module, so Celery will discover them.
# No explicit worker logic is needed here beyond importing the app and tasks.
# The actual task execution is handled by the functions in tasks.py.

# If you need to run specific setup or teardown for the worker process,
# you can add Celery signals here.

# Example of a simple worker setup (if this file were the main entry point for Celery)
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     celery_app.worker_main(['worker', '--loglevel=info', '--pool=solo'])
